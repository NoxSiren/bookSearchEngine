## Description
My task was to take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack with React front-end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This application allows users to search for books, sign up, log in, and see previously saved books. USers also have the ability to remove books from their saved list.
